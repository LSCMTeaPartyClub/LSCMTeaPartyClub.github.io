    body: "The Tea Party Club officially meets weekly from week 1 to 14 each Fall and Spring semester on weekdays on Montgomery Campus. These are called general meetings and require a 'safe space agreement,' which basically means you won't use information from the club or meetings to ruin another's life. <br> <br> We also have planning meetings (required for club officers) and may host or attend events and volunteering activities. <br> We don't put the meeting times and places online. Please email us and we'll verify you're a student using your name and/or LSC email. If we don't have meeting details yet by the time you ask, we'll notify you when we do."

    text: "Currently accepting guests for Fall 2024." 
    subtext: We hope to decide guests, invite and work with them, and complete the paperwork during summer 2024. <br> <br> One of this club's purposes is to chat with political and (supposedly) nonpolitical figures around the table with us instead of on a stage or at a pedestal. We want to contribute to a conversation with our guests rather than listen to a speech or presentation. <br> <br> Lone Star College requires guests to sign a short 'Speaker agreement' form, which needs to be submitted to Student Life weeks in advance. It is linked in the Documents section below. <br> <br> This club created a 'Safe space agreement' to enter general meetings, not campus-wide events we host, that basically says you won't use information from the club to ruin another person's life (excluding 'public firgures'). <br> <br> Please contact LSCMTeaPartyClub@gmail.com or a club officer's email address if interested or for more info!
